* It's now possible to mark network tasks as high priority
* These tasks send notifications with high priority to a separate channel
* Other tasks use default priority (no change)
* Optionally the alarm sound of the device will play whenever a high priority notification is sent (disabled by default)
* The alarm lasts for 60 sec and can be dismissed at any time
* Some minor bug fixes
